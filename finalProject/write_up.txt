concrete goals:
By setting up the server of Nextcloud, the user can upload and download file using the instance's storage. And users can share files
with each other.

methods of testing and verification: 
Simply try to upload, download and share files. If all functions work, then we meet our goals.

effect on its user population:
Because the instance's storage is limited, more users mean less storage per user. Although admins have the access to set quota for users,
we may limit the user population to ensure everyone has enough space. Another way to solve this problem is to set another instance as 
additional space for this server. In addition, the CPU usage may be a problem, but by testing the upload and download function, we find the
CPU usage is not so high, so this may not be a big problem.

user support issues:
Because users access to the server using their own web browser, so there should not be so many issues about supporting.

security issues:
Because both admins and users login with a DNS, we may need to add HTTPS to enhance the security of this server. For user
accounts and files, because all things are saved in the instance and the access to the instance is controlled by the admins, the 
security problem may only caused because the log of the DNS. We could also add a little program to generate key for the admin
account, so hackers can't get the current using key for the admin account.
(in current server, we want to add the HTTPS, but the domain we are using is not a FQDN, so we can't set up those security application for it)

work needed to complete the project:
Actually all the instruction for installing and setting up this server are found online. We just install the package and required package for 
this server, then set up the domain and first admin account for this server. We also change the permission of relevent folders, so admins and
users could access the server simply with the browser.

for maintainance and auto maintaining:
Because all things need to update are those required packages, we could maintain this server simply by keeping updating those packages.
We can also write a module to check for the update. By searching, I learned that there may be some bugs within certain version of Nextcloud,
if the latest version of Nextcloud is not stable, we may stay the old one and wait for the stable updates.
