For shutting one down:

the index page can still be retrived by using the DNS of the balancer

Shutting both:

stop working and report the error code 504 or 503

After restore the service on injoker2 instance:

still showing a error code 503

after restore both instances to service apache2:

still showing a error code 503

after retriving the test page from both instances:

the balancer starts to serve pages again 



Describe the results of testing your load balancer when you shut down one, then both, back-end instances, and when you restore them.

Shut down one (injoker_2): injoker_2 out of service, web page from domain still work, web page from injoker_2 DNS failed

Shut down both:web page no longer accessible

Reboot one or both: webpage work again (it has some delay time)
