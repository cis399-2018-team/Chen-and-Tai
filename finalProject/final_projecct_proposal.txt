After some searching and discussion, we want to set up a Nextcloud server on ouw instances.

Because we are both learning how to do this thing, the method and implementation for this project may change a little bit 

Concrete goals:
	We will set up a Nextcloud server, as a basic cloud server, which users can upload there file to this server and downlaod
it back to their PC. 

Methods of testing:
	Simply make a user account for testing if we can upload and download from the server, if it's available for one user, then 
add more users.

Verification:
	If all uploads and downloads are successful, then it's done.

Effect on its user population:
	Because the storage of the server is limited, more user means less storage per user. And the server may stop working if too many
users upload and download at about the same time.

User support issues:
	For this one, I think there may be some problem raised when we test it, but right now I have no idea what and how they will be.

Security issues:
	Maybe some users may upload some unsafe files or application to the server, so we need some backup method for this problem.

For complete the project:
	Installing the dependencies, create the database, configure apache
	Same as the concrete goals, if we have more time, we may think about adding some function or extensions to convince the users.

For maintaining:
	Basicly keep update the package we used for this project, and fix or find method to avoid the bugs with the updates, we may need
to not keep updating to skip some version with too many bugs, and only update to the solid ones. Because of this, we can just simply check
if there is a new update, but I don't think it's the best way.

Documentation for administrator and users:
	For admins: some basic status of the server like total storage, users and groups, the current version of package, some advice of user
managing

	For users: the function they could use and the method to use it, also the current version of package, and some notification about the
security problem (like the admins may backup or stop their personal use for this server)

Here is what I could think of this project right now, and I will fill up more details for this during the process we work on the project.
