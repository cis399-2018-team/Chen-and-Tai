*I tried to trigger the alarm for disk reads and writes, but I found I can't. Do you have some good idea?
 I searched online and somebody said that the storage of EC2 is different from the monitoring ones, so those monitors don't show the actual
 status of EC2 instances. I am not sure it's correct or not.
